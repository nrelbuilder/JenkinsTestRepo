Change to see jenkins do SOMETHING

oijsdfdsf

-------------------------------------
Below is output of a conflict between branch3 and branch1
	* Branch3 made a change, pushed and Jenkins picked it
	  up and merged it into MASTER
	* Branch1 made a change and pushed it before Jenkins
	  was able to update Branch1 with the change made by
	  branch3.  This caused MASTER to be out of sync.

Another change


Touched by branch3


-------------------------------------
Resolution:
	* Only resolution I can think of is for the Branch1 user
	  to make sure they do a merge to MASTER before they do
	  a push.
